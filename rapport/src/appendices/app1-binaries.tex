\chapter{Binaries}

\section{HM encoder}
\label[secinapp]{app:binaries}
Fraunhofer standard encoder. Allows options QP, RDOQ, SBH. Open-source, written in C++~\cite[p.~15]{Wien_Coding_Tools}

\section{HM decoder}
Decodes any conforming HEVC bitstream. Open-source, written in C++.~\cite[p.~16]{Wien_Coding_Tools}

\section{d65{\_}gt}
Our biggest contribution to this project. One piece of source code, that by setting different preprocessor macros can compile into pruner, decoding order decoder and reconstructor. Written in C.

\section{d65? downscaler}
A 5 tap downscaler which generates a pretty quick downsampling of any raw (decoded) video. [Explain downsampling here probably]

\section{PSNR Static}
A simple program that compares an encoded video with its original to gauge the level of compression. Gives values for each frames in 3 components (Y, Cb, Cr) and a grand total for the sequence, which is the one we are most interested in.
