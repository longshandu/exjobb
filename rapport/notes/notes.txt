QUANTIZATION
Slides, 9-29

RATE DISTORTION
Slides, 9-20

LOSSLESS CODING (VLC)
Slides, 9-12: Variable length coding, prefix codes

PSNR
Gonazles (3ed, p. 375) discusses SNR (as they call it) in general terms. Mentions that it might not "relate well to images quality".

SUBSAMPLING (Could be useful for explaining downsampling with 5/13 taps)

Slides, 4-9
