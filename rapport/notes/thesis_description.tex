I compared methods for transmitting downscaled versions of high-quality video in more effecient ways for use in streaming services.

Instead of transmitting full encodings of each size, only the highest-quality version is sent, along with "side-information" from the lower-quality versions generated by removing motion coefficients. At a certain cost in computational power at the reciever the lower-quality video can then be recreated.

I investigated the performance effects of varying the number of neighbouring pixels utilized when downscaling (a trade-off between computational complexity and a more faithful image representation) as well as working on implementing experimental algorithms in the encoder to losslessly reduce bitrates.
