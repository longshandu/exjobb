Master Thesis in Video Compression - Sufficient Prerequisite Knowledge?

Hi!

I have been offered a Master thesis project on video compression by Ericsson Research and I am looking for an examinator. I study Computer Science and I did my specialization in Software Development.

I have some questions about whether or not my prerequisite knowledge is sufficient for me to do the project. I have talked to Flavius Gruian who told me that an advanced course on the subject is required, which I am not completely sure what it means. I have not taken any courses from the Images and Computer Graphics specialization so if that is what is required then I might have a problem.

At the Ericsson interview I was asked about different formats for audio and video compression and the recruiters seemed happy with my answers. I also took a test where I wrote code in C and answered fact questions on programming and compression. During the project I am expected to study the details of HEVC/H.265 and work on improving a HEVC encoder written in C/C++.

I guess that the actual amount of programming within the project could have a certain influence on how the university choses to value my current knowledge. I think that Advanced Algorithms (course code EDAN55) might qualify me to work on a project with high demands on fast and effective code. How do you feel about it?

Would you be interested of acting as examinator for my thesis, or do you know of any other teacher that I should talk to? I can also send you the ad for the project if it is of any interest.


Best regards,
Harald Nordgren
